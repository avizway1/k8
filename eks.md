## **What is EKS?**  
**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS infrastructure. With EKS, you can run Kubernetes without needing to install, operate, or maintain your own control plane or nodes.

## **Key Features of EKS**  
1. **Managed Control Plane**:  
   - AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler, etc.), ensuring high availability and reliability.  
   - The control plane is automatically scaled and patched by AWS.  

2. **Integration with AWS Services**:  
   - Seamlessly integrates with AWS services like **IAM**, **VPC**, **CloudWatch**, **Load Balancers**, and **RDS**.  
   - Enables secure and scalable application architectures.  

3. **High Availability**:  
   - The control plane runs across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure fault tolerance.  
   - Worker nodes can also be distributed across AZs for resilience.  

4. **Security**:  
   - Integrates with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control.  
   - Supports encryption for data at rest and in transit.  
   - Provides network isolation using VPC and security groups.  

5. **Scalability**:  
   - Automatically scales worker nodes using **Cluster Autoscaler** or **AWS Fargate** for serverless workloads.  
   - Handles thousands of nodes and pods efficiently.  

6. **Cost-Effective**:  
   - Pay only for the resources you use (worker nodes, EBS volumes, etc.).  
   - No additional charge for the managed control plane (starting October 2020).  

7. **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Support**:  
   - Supports **EKS Anywhere**, allowing you to run Kubernetes clusters on-premises or in other clouds.  
   - Provides consistent tooling and APIs across environments.

## **EKS vs Self-Managed Kubernetes**  


| Feature | Self-Managed Kubernetes | Amazon EKS |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Control Plane Management** | You must set up and maintain the Kubernetes control plane (API server, scheduler, controller manager, etc.). | AWS fully manages the control plane, including scaling, security, and updates. |
| **Worker Nodes** | You need to provision and manage worker nodes (on-premises or cloud VMs). | You only manage worker nodes; AWS handles the control plane. |
| **High Availability** | You must configure HA across multiple servers and regions. | AWS automatically runs the control plane across multiple Availability Zones for HA. |
| **Networking** | Requires setting up Kubernetes networking manually. | Integrates with AWS networking (VPC, ALB, NLB, etc.). |
| **Security & IAM** | You manage authentication, RBAC, and security policies. | Integrated with AWS IAM, security groups, and encryption for easy access control. |
| **Upgrades & Patching** | You need to manually upgrade and patch Kubernetes versions. | AWS provides automated upgrades and patches for the control plane. |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | You must configure tools like Prometheus and Grafana. | Integrated with AWS services like CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and X-Ray. |
| **Autoscaling** | Requires configuring Cluster Autoscaler manually. | Supports AWS Auto Scaling for nodes and pods with seamless integration. |
| **Integration with AWS Services** | Requires custom configurations for AWS integrations. | Built-in support for AWS services like ECR, IAM, CloudWatch, and RDS. |
| **Pricing** | Free, but you pay for the infrastructure you use (compute, storage, etc.). | You pay for worker nodes plus an additional charge of ~$0.10 per hour per EKS cluster. |
